# Pasta Burger, the exciting sequel
This app takes the MVC design pattern, Handlebars, MySQL, and custom CSS layout of the original [Pasta Burger app](https://github.com/slizbethellis/Pasta-Burger), and reworks it with Sequelize. There is also added functionality in that this version adds a second database for customers, and uses associations (a.k.a. joins in vanilla MySQL) and sorting.
